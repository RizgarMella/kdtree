		<h1>kdtree library manual</h1>
		<h2>installation guide</h2>

		<p>
			Setting up kdtree for use is extremely easy. There are two ways to use this
			library: you can either "properly" install it in the system, or just include the
			source files in your project, since the library is extremely small.
		</p>

		<h3>proper installation</h3>
		<p>
			Just run: <code>./configure</code>, <code>make</code>, and <code>make
			install</code> (the last one should be executed as root if you are installing the
			library system-wide).
